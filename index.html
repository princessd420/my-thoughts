           <h1>Hello Zayd!</h1>
               <h2>What is going on?</h2>

           <p>In the midst of waiting for you to text me back, I decided to learn your language!
               While this is very basic, and probably laughable to someone who fluently speaks computer, this is my attempt to get a peak into your world.
               <h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
                   <img src="cat-pic.jpeg" width="200" height="200"/>
           
            <p>I try my best to live my life in a way where I am authentic in expressing the truth of my nature. Even if that means sometimes my feelings aren’t reciprocated. While the spirit of my words means well, I understand that everyone lives their own colorful lives with elements that I will never know about. To get to the point, I think about you often, but I also want to be respectful of your life and everything you have going on. With that being said, I think I need to let you go.</p>
                   <p>I would also like to tell you that I am sorry if anything I did or said left a bad taste in your mouth, it was never my intention.</p>
               <p>I guess this also serves as a way for me to conceptualize my melodramatic tendencies.</p>
              <p>I hope this doesn’t come off weird, maybe you can appreciate it, even if it's just from just a creative standpoint? </p>
       <h2>So Now What?</h2>
           <p>Well now you go be Zayd and I will go be Diana. Just know I am rooting for you! I hope your ambition carries you to the end of all your goals and that your curiosity guides you to new adventures. May you always see the brightest stars in the sky! I hope you are well, and always remember that coincidences don’t exist!</p>
              <p>P.S.</p>
              <p>Just know that whoever gets to be your romantic interest in the future is very lucky! Good luck with everything!</p>
               <p>Love,</p>
               <p>Diana</p>
