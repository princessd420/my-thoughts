    <h1>Hello Zayd!</h1>
    <h2>What is going on?</h2>

    <p>In the midst of waiting for you to text me back, I decided to learn your language!
    While this is very basic, and probably laughable to someone who fluently speaks computer, this is my attempt to get a peek into your world.</p>

    <h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>

    <p>Well, to be quite honest, I can't stop thinking about you. I'd love to see you again but I understand that you have a lot going on.
    With that being said, I think I need to let you go. I have been swarmed with thoughts of Zayd. 
    Wondering what you're working on or how your day is going. Making random lists of things I want to tell you. Checking the little page on your blog with my name on it to see if it has been updated.
    It is starting to feel a little pathetic. I am sorry if anything I did or said left a bad taste in your mouth, it was never my intention.</p>

    <p>I guess this also serves as a reminder to myself that I am just as cool as you. It is also a nice way for me to conceptualize my melodramatic tendencies.</p>

    <h2>My Confession</h2>
    <img src="window.jpeg"/>
    <p>I remember when we were kissing in your car you asked me, "who do you work for?". I know you meant it in a lighthearted way...
    </p>

    <h2>So Now What?</h2>
    <p>Well now you go be Zayd and I will go be Diana. Just know I am rooting for you! I hope your ambition carries you to the end of all your goals and that your curiosity guides you to new adventures. I hope you always see the brightest constellations in the sky!
    Just know that whoever gets to be your romantic interest in the future is very lucky! Good luck with everything!</p>

    <p>Love,</p>
    <p>Diana</p>
